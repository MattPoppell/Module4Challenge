# Module 4 Challengee

## Description
In this challenge, I was tasked with building a quiz that displayed when a button was pressed in a web application setting.  This was a challenge for me, for sure.  I used Javascript to make the HTML page dynamic and responsive to the user's choices (their chosen answers to the questions).  This challenge was helpful however in assisting me in really learning about local storage in a practical way.

## Installation
No installation necessary. Application will run upon loading of the page.

## Usage
Upon the page loading, the user is encourage to initiate a quiz about front-end programming languages by clicking the "start" button.  A timer starts and the user is then prompted with a question and four possible answers.  If the correct answer is chosen, the user is alerted, a point is added to their score, and a new question appears.  If an incorrect answer is chosen, th euser is alerted and additional time is taken off of the clock. At the end of the quiz (or the end of the timer, whichever comes first) a final score is displaye and the user is prompted to submit their initials to be recorded with their score.  An option to restart the quiz is then given.
